#### Program description

Sponsorships profiles:

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/sponsors/mpostol) anyone with a GitHub account can sponsor anyone with a sponsored developer profile through a recurring monthly payment. You can choose from multiple sponsorship tiers, with monthly payment amounts and benefits that are set. For more information, see [About GitHub Sponsors](https://help.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors)

- [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/mpostol) - Patrons are the keepers of the cash, the power people with the credit/debit cards. A patron will kick-off the chain of events by typing in credit/debit card info, or syncing a payment account, like PayPal. A more detailed description is covered by the [Payment Glossary - payment processing on Patreon](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024774831-Payment-Glossary-payment-processing-on-Patreon).
