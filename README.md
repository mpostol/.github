### [Publish CFIS](https://github.com/users/mpostol/projects/3)

CAS Flight Inspection System of the radio navigation aids (CFIS) is used for the airborne evaluation of the accuracy and performance of ground navigation facilities. The system provides the capability to inspect the following aids:

- ILS (instrument landing system),
- MKS (ILS associated approach markers),
- VOR (VHF omnidirectional range),
- DME (distance measuring equipment),
- NDB (non-directional beacon system),
- VHF (communication) and radar systems

### [Publish Smart Factory](https://github.com/users/mpostol/projects/2)

[Smart Factory](http://www.cas.eu/Products/SmartFactory.aspx) software family - a workflow management system is a group of CAS applications that support automation of business processes, through their precise definition and control of the flow of information and synchronization of the internal and external participantsâ€™ activities.

Smart Factory applications support:

- Group work in the field of logistics (Shepherd),
- Customs clearing (Inward Process Relief),
- Agile project management (Agile Workload Tracker).

Collaboration is a core to improve processes in any organization. It requires information sharing as well as following precisely defined procedures. Both information and behavioral models must be consistent and fulfill business requirements leading to improvements in process performance measured using Key Performance Indicators in critical areas. To be useful for daily process management these indicators must be observable. To engage adoptive information models, control workflows and use Business Intelligence to measure the process performance our applications are deployed on the Microsoft SharePoint as a human-centric foundation using Web Applications to publish and share the content.

### [CommServer integration with the OOI](https://github.com/users/mpostol/projects/1)

`CommServer` is a software package to manage data transfer. Built-in technologies and algorithms provide a smart data transmission that automatically adapts its parameters to the process needs and underlying communication network capabilities. To learn more about `CommServer` software family visit the [software home page](http://www.commsvr.com/).

The `CommServer` software was written by CAS Lodz Poland. I am the founder and Executive Director of CAS. Now CAS is just an individual business activity conducted by me, so I decided to port this software to Open Source (OSS) and integrate it with the more general concept Object-Oriented Internet. OSS is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

The import process is managed using an independent project: [Management of the migration to open source process](https://github.com/commsvr-com/migration2os). However, the main purpose of this project is to manage the transfer of the multi-parts CommServer software from an on-premise subversion repository to a set of GitHub repositories and finally integrate it with the OOI.

The linked repositories are listed below.
