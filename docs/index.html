      <p>It is said that we are or soon will be citizens of a global village - a world considered as a single community
        linked by telecommunications. All applications designed atop of network communication can be grouped as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>human-centric</strong> - applications where the information origin or information destination is an
          operator</li>
        <li><strong>machine-centric</strong> - applications where information creation, consumption, networking, and
          processing are achieved entirely without human interaction</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A typical <strong>human-centric</strong> approach is web-service supporting, for example, online bank account
        management. In this case, it is essential that any uncertainty and necessity to make a decision can be relaxed
        by human interaction. Coordination of multi-robot behavior in a work-cell or autonomous cars entering a service
        area fulfills the <strong>machine-centric</strong> scenario. It is crucial that, in this case, any human
        interaction is impractical or even impossible. <strong>This interoperability scenario requires a machine to
          machine communication (M2M) demanding multi-vendor devices integration</strong>.</p>
      <p>The human-centric global village is almost done. However, the machine-centric global village still needs design
        and development effort. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has provided society with a vast variety
        of distributed machine-oriented applications including the meaningful Machine to Machine (M2M) communication
        targeting distributed mobile applications in the context of new emerging disciplines, i.e. Industry 4.0 (I40)
        and Internet of Things (IoT). However, it is a real challenge if the mentioned machines are provided by a vast
        variety of vendors. The real challenge we are facing is how to produce independently smart things (i.e.
        machines, devices, appliances, assets, etc.) to guarantee that they are plug and produce ready. There are no
        doubts, it requires standardization. I believe that while producing the machines in compliance with the OPC UA
        this issue is relaxed by applying the following OPC UA standardized concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Information Model</strong> - all about how to design a formal but mutually meaningful and shareable
          description of the considered process</li>
        <li><strong>Address Space</strong> - all about how to instantiate and expose to the network a life replica of
          the process providing real-time data according to the above-mentioned formal description</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The standardization process may be “paper-driven” or “community-driven”. In both cases, standardization is
        indispensable but not sufficient. Let me recall that the foundation for the human-centric global village is just
        the Internet Protocol defined many years ago and derived from the university intellectual properties published
        as an open-access document (RFC “paper”).</p>
      <p>The open-access <a href="https://commsvr.gitbook.io/ooi/readme"><strong>Object-Oriented Internet</strong>
          (OOI)</a> umbrella project targets multi-vendor plug-and-produce machines interoperability scenarios targeting
        all aspects of the machine-centric global village concept aimed at providing reusable deliverables, training,
        best practice rules, prototyping, compliance testing and dissemination of valuable results.</p>
      <p>Concluding, to make real progress, I propose to focus on leveraging:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>well-known concepts, e.g. <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>, Service-Oriented Architecture,
          Data-Oriented Architecture (DOA), cloud computing, etc.</li>
        <li>existing and emerging standards, e.g. OPC UA, AMQP, MQTT, etc.</li>
        <li>converged academic knowledge and practitioners experience</li>
        <li>available human-centric global village interoperability platforms, e.g. <a
